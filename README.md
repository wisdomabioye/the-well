# The Well

The Well is a modular Bitcoin Alkanes launchpad and game arcade. This repository is the shared
Turborepo foundation for the web application, feature plugins, reusable UI, runtime-neutral
contracts, configuration, and provider-neutral PostgreSQL infrastructure.

The product is intentionally at foundation stage. Transactional launchpad and wallet controls stay
gated until their product decisions and end-to-end verification are complete.

## Workspace

- `apps/web` — Next.js application and public arcade shell.
- `features/*` — self-describing feature registrations and lazy entrypoints.
- `packages/plugin-kit` — feature validation, dependency graph, and loading boundary.
- `packages/shared` — runtime-neutral contracts grouped by domain.
- `packages/config` — environment catalog, validation, and mirror checks.
- `packages/database` — PostgreSQL/Drizzle connections and explicit migrations.
- `packages/ui` — reusable arcade components and design tokens.
- `tests/e2e` — Playwright browser coverage.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 or newer
- pnpm 10.22.0
- Docker for PostgreSQL integration and coverage tests
- Playwright Chromium for browser tests

Install dependencies with `pnpm install`. Copy the appropriate checked-in environment example to
an ignored runtime environment file and replace every placeholder needed by that environment.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm env:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm migration:check
pnpm build
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm format:check
```

Database migrations are never applied during application startup. Deployment automation must run
`pnpm --filter @ador/database migration:apply` as an explicit pre-deploy step.

## Architecture rules

Features are registered explicitly in `configs/features.ts`; the application does not discover
modules through filesystem scanning or import side effects. Shared contracts remain independent of
Next.js and provider SDKs. PostgreSQL access uses standard connection URLs so Railway, Supabase, or
another compatible provider can be selected without changing application code.

Every workspace package exposes a typecheck and meaningful test boundary. Coverage thresholds are
strictly above 90%, environment examples are pinned to one canonical key order, and handwritten
source and test files must remain at or below 300 physical lines.
