# `@repo/repository-policy`

Executable repository invariants for The Well. The package validates workspace test scripts,
handwritten source-file limits, architectural import boundaries, and decision-gate documentation.
It also combines workspace coverage summaries and LCOV records into a root report while enforcing
greater-than-90% line and branch coverage per workspace and in aggregate.

Run `pnpm repository:check` for static policies, `pnpm decision:check` for the decision catalog,
and `pnpm repository:coverage` after workspace coverage reports exist. Root and CI commands invoke
these gates automatically.
