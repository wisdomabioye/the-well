# Launchpad Beta implementation task ledger

Status: active  
Milestone: Launchpad Beta  
Canonical status source: this file  
Last synchronized: 2026-09-12

This ledger tracks every implementation task in the eight-week Launchpad Beta milestone. The
milestone defines scope and acceptance criteria; this file records execution status. Task records
under `references/` retain detailed evidence, baselines, decisions, and review results.

## Status contract

- `completed`: implementation and required verification finished; a converged task record exists.
- `in_progress`: the only task currently being changed.
- `pending`: ready after its dependencies and decision gates are satisfied.
- `blocked`: cannot start because a named external dependency or decision gate is unresolved.
- `deferred`: explicitly outside this milestone; tracked in the milestone rather than here.

Only one task may be `in_progress`. A task may become `completed` only after its own diff receives a
`Converged` verdict under the repository review workflow. Whenever implementation starts, completes,
becomes blocked, or is unblocked, this ledger and the applicable task record must be updated in the
same change. Never infer completion from a commit, passing test, or partially delivered dependency.

## Synchronization checklist

For every implementation task:

1. Change its status here to `in_progress` before implementation and name its dependencies.
2. Create or update its task record under `references/` with baseline and done criteria.
3. If new work is discovered, add a stable task ID here instead of silently expanding scope.
4. Record blockers as concrete gates; do not replace them with assumptions or feature flags.
5. After all gates and the required deep review converge, change the status to `completed` in the
   same commit as the final task record.
6. Set the next eligible task to `in_progress` only after the prior task is completed.
