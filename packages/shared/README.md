# `@ador/shared`

Runtime-neutral contracts and pure domain behavior shared by browser and server runtimes.

## Public API

- `@ador/shared/allowlists` — strict Leaf V1 bytes, decoder, and SHA-256 Merkle primitives used by
  browser, server, and contract fixture tooling.
- `@ador/shared/features` — versioned feature identifiers, capabilities, pages, navigation, and
  manifest schema.
- `@ador/shared/decisions` — accepted-decision records and fail-closed gate evaluation.
- `@ador/shared/http` — HTTP headers, methods, idempotency policy, and the versioned error envelope.
- `@ador/shared/platform` — public platform-status input and output contracts.
- `@ador/shared/providers` — provider identities and capability-bearing manifests.

## Boundaries

This package may use runtime schemas and pure TypeScript. It must not import React, Next.js,
database clients, provider SDKs, Node-only APIs, browser globals, secrets, or feature internals.
New exports belong to a named domain subpath; there is no catch-all utilities module.

The allowlist hash implementation pins `@noble/hashes` 2.4.0: it is MIT-licensed, maintained,
runtime-neutral, and avoids separate browser/server cryptographic implementations. SHA-256 and its
sorted-pair convention are protocol behavior and are locked by Rust/TypeScript fixtures.

## Invariants

- Feature IDs are lowercase kebab-case.
- Feature versions use an explicit three-part semantic version.
- Every feature declares at least one supported capability.
- Manifests reject undeclared fields.
- Feature routes and provider requirements are runtime-validated boot contracts.
- Navigation destinations and labels are strict, unique per feature, and require the declared
  navigation capability.
- Accepted decisions require an owner, date, selected outcome, ADR, and evidence records.
- Correlation IDs are UUIDs and idempotency keys are bounded opaque values.
- HTTP errors use one strict, versioned public envelope.
- Allowlist leaves use deterministic little-endian bytes, reject trailing data and unsupported
  tags, and bind network, launch, phase, snapshot, script, allocation, asset, price, and validity.

## Verification

Run `pnpm --filter @ador/shared typecheck`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`, or `test:coverage`.
