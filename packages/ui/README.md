# `@repo/ui`

Shared Adorbitals design-system package. It owns semantic visual tokens, accessible primitives,
arcade components, and platform patterns derived from the immutable standalone arcade reference.

## Public API

- `@repo/ui/arcade` exports `AppShell`, `ArcadeButton`, `ArcadePanel`, and `StatusLamp`.
- `@repo/ui/styles.css` installs tokens and shared component styles.

Consumers compose these exports and must not copy their CSS or use raw brand colors. Status tones
describe view state only; the caller remains responsible for deriving truthful state from its
authoritative domain model.

## Dependencies and configuration

The package depends only on React and React DOM. Font variables are supplied by the delivery
application so each host can self-host the approved Bungee, Chakra Petch, and Press Start 2P faces.
No environment configuration is consumed here.

## Verification

Run `pnpm --filter @repo/ui typecheck`, `test:unit`, `test:integration`, and `test:coverage` from the
repository root. Shared interactions and semantics require positive and negative tests; route-level
responsive and accessibility behavior belongs in Playwright.

Operational ownership: platform design-system maintainers.
